.SH NAME
_printf \- custom implementation of printf

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR _printf ()
function produces output according to a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.

This function is a simplified version of the standard
.BR printf (3)
function from the C standard library.

.SS Format String
The format string is a character string composed of zero or more directives:
ordinary characters (not
.BR % ),
which are copied unchanged to the output stream, and conversion specifications,
each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

Each conversion specification is introduced by the character
.BR % ,
and ends with a
.I "conversion specifier".

.SS Conversion Specifiers
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.TP
.B c
The
.I int
argument is converted to an
.IR "unsigned char" ,
and the resulting character is written.

.TP
.B s
The
.I "const char *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array (string).
Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating
null byte ('\\0'). If the argument is NULL, the string "(null)" is written.

.TP
.B d, i
The
.I int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

.TP
.B %
A '%' character is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
specification is '%%'.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, the
.BR _printf ()
function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte
used to end output to strings).

If an error occurs, a negative value is returned.

.SH EXAMPLES
To print "Hello, World!":
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
_printf("Hello, World!\\n");
.EE
.in

To print an integer:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
_printf("The number is %d\\n", 42);
.EE
.in

To print a character and a string:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
_printf("Character: %c, String: %s\\n", 'A', "test");
.EE
.in

To print a percent sign:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
_printf("100%% complete\\n");
.EE
.in
